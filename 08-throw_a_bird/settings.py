Study Case: Throw a Bird

Author: Alejandro Mujica

This file contains the game settings that include the association of the
inputs with their ids, constants of values to set up the game, sounds,
textures, and fonts. This game has no sound assets in the original Defold
project, so no gale.mixer/pygame.mixer setup is done here.

Unlike lessons 00-07 (all tile/sprite-sheet based), every graphic here is
its own loose PNG (no atlas), so there is no gale.frames slicing: TEXTURES
values are used directly as whole-image surfaces.

# Physics tuning. gale.physics.World defaults to pixels_per_meter=30 and

# The original Defold project used physics.scale=0.02 (50px/meter) with
# gravity_y=-1000 -- neither number carries over meaningfully to gale's
# own default scale, so this is retuned from scratch for a "normal
# feeling" downward pull at ppm=30, matching gale's own physics examples

# bearing, it only needs to keep everything at a sane, mostly-positive
# world y (Box2D doesn't care about negative coordinates either way).
