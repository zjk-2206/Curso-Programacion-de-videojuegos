Study Case: The Legend of the Princess (ARPG)

This file contains the Command classes shared by the player (driven by
InputHandler through CommandBindings) and by any AI-controlled entity
(driven directly from its own state's process_ai). Every Command only
records intent on the receiver -- held[direction], sword_requested,
interact_requested -- which every Entity (held) or Player
(sword_requested/interact_requested) already exposes, so the same
instance works for both a human-controlled entity and an AI-controlled
one. Turning that intent into an actual effect (resolving held into a
direction and moving, whether a sword swing or a pot pickup/throw is
currently allowed) is resolved every frame by the receiving entity's
own state, never by the Command itself.
